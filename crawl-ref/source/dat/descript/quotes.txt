“When Peleus, some distance away, saw him torn apart by the frightful wound he
shouted: ‘Accept this tribute to the dead, at least, Crantor, dearest of
youths’, and with his powerful arm, he hurled his ash spear, at full strength,
at Demoleon. It ruptured the ribcage, and stuck quivering in the bone. The
centaur pulled out the shaft minus its head (he tried with difficulty to reach
that also) but the head was caught in his lung. The pain itself strengthened
his will: wounded, he reared up at his enemy and beat the hero down with his
hooves. Peleus received the resounding blows on helmet and shield, and
defending his upper arms, and controlling the weapon he held out, with one blow
through the arm he pierced the bi-formed breast.”

“But Sigmund turned him about, and he said: ‘What aileth thee, son?
 Shall our life-days never be merry, and our labour never be done?’

 But Sinfiotli said: ‘I have looked, and lo, there is death in the cup.’

 And the song, and the tinkling of harp-strings to the roof-tree winded up;
 And Sigmund was dreamy with wine and the wearing of many a year;
 And the noise and the glee of the people as the sound of the wild woods were
 And the blossoming boughs of the Branstock were the wild trees waving about;

 So he said: ‘Well seen, my fosterling; let the lip then strain it out.’”

 They are furious, they devise mischief without resting night and day.
 They prepare for battle, fuming and raging;
 They have joined their forces and are making war.
 Tiamat who formed all things,
 Made in addition weapons invincible; she spawned monster-serpents,
 Sharp of tooth, and merciless of fang;
 With poison, instead of blood, she filled their bodies.
 Fierce monster-vipers she clothed with terror,
 With splendor she decked them, she made them of lofty stature.
 Whoever beheld them, terror overcame him,
 Their bodies reared up and none could withstand their attack.”

blowgun

“Along the Upper Caiary-Uaupes blow-guns are made from the stems of a variety
of palm (Iriartea setigera Martius)... The Indian selects two stems of such
sizes that the smaller will exactly fit within the larger. After these stems
have been carefully dried and the pith cleared out with a long rod, the bore is
made smooth by drawing back and forth through it a little bunch of tree-fern
roots. The smaller stem is then inserted in the larger, so that one will serve
to correct any crookedness that may exist in the other. The wooden mouth-piece
is then fitted to one end, and about three and one half feet from it, a boar's
tooth is fastened on the gun by some gummy substance, for a sight. Over the
outside the maker winds spirally a strip of the dark shiny bark of a creeper
which gives it an ornamental finish, and his blow-gun is complete.
 ”The arrows are from ten to fourteen inches long, and of the thickness of an
ordinary lucifer match. Those of the Indians of the Caiary-Uaupes are made from
the midrib of a palm leaf or of the spinous processes of the Patawa (Enocarpus
Batawa) sharpened to a point at one end and wound near the other with a
delicate sort of wild cotton which grows in a pod upon a large tree (Bombax
ceiba). This mass of cotton is just big enough to fill the tube when the arrow
is gently pressed into it. The point is dipped into poison, allowed to dry, and
redipped until well coated. The exact composition of this poison is unknown,
and probably varies in different localities; but it would seem that the chief
ingredient is always the juice of a Strychnos plant. It is known among
different tribes by many names; such as Curari, Ourari, Urari and Woorali.”

to have a great aversion to children. As there is no point on which a parent
feels more acutely than that of the maltreatment of his offspring, the feelings

“Then Robin he unbuckled his belt,
 And laid down his bow so long;
 He took up a staff of another oak graff,
 That was both stiff and strong.
 ‘But let me measure,’ said jolly Robin,
 ‘Before we begin our fray;
 For I'll not have mine to be longer than thine,
 For that will be counted foul play.’
 ‘I pass not for length,’ bold Arthur replied,
 ‘My staff is of oak so free;
 Eight foot and a half it will knock down a calf,
 And I hope it will knock down thee.’
 Then Robin could no longer forbear,
 He gave him such a knock,
 Quickly and soon the blood came down,
 Before it was ten o'clock.
 About and about and about they went,
 Like two wild boars in a chase,
 Striving to aim each other to maim,
 Leg, arm, or any other place.
 And knock for knock they hastily dealt,
 Which held for two hours and more;
 That all the wood rang at every bang,
 They plied their work so sore.”

trident

“Without noticing the occupations of an intervening day or two, which, as they
consisted of the ordinary sylvan amusements of shooting and coursing, have
nothing sufficiently interesting to detain the reader, we pass to one in some
degree peculiar to Scotland, which may be called a sort of salmon-hunting. This
chase, in which the fish is pursued and struck with barbed spears, or a sort of
long shafted trident, called a waster, is much practised at the mouth of the
Esk, and in the other salmon rivers of Scotland.”
    -Sir Walter Scott, _Guy Mannering_, ch. XXVI. 1815.

“THE TROLL KING: Now, listen, Prince Peer, and give way to reason!
 You're cut out for a Troll. Why, look, already
 You bear yourself quite in a Troll-like fashion!
 And you want to become one, don't you?
 PEER GYNT: Of course.
 In return for a bride and a well-found kingdom
 I'm not unwilling to sacrifice something;
 But all things have their natural limit.
 I have taken a tail, it is true; but, then,
 I can undo the knots that our friend has tied
 And take the thing off. I have shed my breeches;
 They were old and patched; but that won't prevent me
 From putting them on if I have a mind to.
 I shall probably find it just as easy
 To deal with your Trollish way of living.
 I can easily swear that a cow's a maiden;
 An oath's not a difficult thing to swallow.
 But to know that one never can get one's freedom —
 Not even to die as a human being —
 To end one's days as a Troll of the mountains —
 Never go back, as you tell me plainly —
 That is a thing that I'll not submit to.”

“Beauty is no quality in things themselves: It exists merely in the mind which
contemplates them; and each mind perceives a different beauty. One person may
even perceive deformity, where another is sensible of beauty; and every
individual ought to acquiesce in his own sentiment, without pretending to
regulate those of others.”

Urug

U r u g, tumbled down, fallen by crumbling down. Slipped down, as earth from a
hill-side, stones which have been piled up or the like. To fall as water at a
cascade. To fill up a hollow by putting earth into it. To lay gravel or
materials on a road. A landslip.

U r u r u g a n, apparently a plural form of 'Urug'. To go with a number of
men to any work. To make war, to attack with an army. To set upon in numbers,
as it were to tumble upon in masses.

“Telimena, wearied with the prolonged wrangling, wanted to go out into the

“Gentlemen, I see that you wish to remain within doors,” she said, wrapping
around her head a red cashmere shawl, “but I am going for mushrooms: follow me
who will!” Under one arm she took the little daughter of the Chamberlain, with
the other she raised her skirt up to her ankles. Thaddeus silently hastened

“Their innumerable sculptures of demons and dragons assumed a lugubrious
aspect. The restless light of the flame made them move to the eye. There were
griffins which had the air of laughing, gargoyles which one fancied one heard
yelping, salamanders which puffed at the fire, tarasques which sneezed in the
smoke. And among the monsters thus roused from their sleep of stone by this
flame, by this noise, there was one who walked about, and who was seen, from
time to time, to pass across the glowing face of the pile, like a bat in front
of a candle.”

“He fixed his eyes upon the door, which, slowly opening, disclosed a stranger
of majestic form, but scowling features, who demanded sternly, why he was
summoned? ‘I did not summon you,’ said the trembling student. ‘You did!’ said
the stranger, advancing, angrily; ‘and the demons are not to be invoked in
vain.’ The student could make no reply; and the demon, enraged that one of the
uninitiated should have summoned him out of mere presumption, seized him by the
throat and strangled him.

When Agrippa returned, a few days afterwards, he found his house beset with
devils. Some of them were sitting on the chimneypots, kicking up their legs in
the air; while others were playing at leapfrog, on the very edge of the

his way to his desk.”

“It seemed that while the zombie came from the grave, it was neither a ghost,
nor yet a person who had been raised like Lazarus from the dead. The zombie,
they say, is a soulless human corpse, still dead, but taken from the grave and
endowed by sorcery with a mechanical semblance of life—it is a dead body which
is made to walk and act and move as if it were alive. People who have the power
to do this go to a fresh grave, dig up the body before it has had time to rot,
galvanize it into movement, and then make of it a servant or slave,
occasionally for the commission of some crime, more often simply as a drudge
around the habitation or the farm, setting it dull heavy tasks, and beating it
like a dumb beast if it slackens.”
